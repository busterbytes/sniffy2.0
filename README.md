	# Sniffy is a TCP packet sniffer and quite easy to use.    # 
	# Just activate sniffy and pass it the pcap file you       # 
	# would like to extract TCP packet information from        # 
	# Like this:                                               # 
	#                                                          # 
	#               ./sniffy mypcap.pcap                       # 
	#                                                          #  
	# Sniffy will extract all information available from all   # 
	# TCP packets inside of your pcap, including packet data   # 
	# if available and will write all of the data into a file  # 
	# named sniffy_output.txt in your current directory.       # 
	#                                                          #

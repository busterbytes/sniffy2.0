	# Sniffy 2.0 is a packet sniffer and quite easy to use.    # 
	# Just run  ./sniffy2.0 from the command line              # 
	# choose the pcap you would like to extract info           # 
	# and then choose the protocol of the packets you'd like   # 
	# to see information about                                 # 
	#                                                          # 
	#                                                          #  
	# Sniffy will extract all information available from all   # 
	# packets of that protocol inside of your pcap,            #
	# including packet data if available and will write all    #
	# of the data to the screen and then into a file           # 
	# named sniffy_output.txt in your current directory.       # 
	#                                                          #
